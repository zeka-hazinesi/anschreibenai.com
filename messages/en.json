    "answer1": "ChatGPT is a brilliant tool, but it's not suitable for all applications. It's particularly not optimal for creating PDF documents. The DIN 5008 standard is very specific and requires precise formatting that ChatGPT can't always provide. With this app, you can ensure that your documents meet the requirements of DIN 5008.",
    "answer2": "DIN 5008 is a German standard that establishes rules for writing and designing business letters and other business documents. It ensures a uniform, professional appearance, e.g. in addressing, date information, highlights and formatting. We have implemented the most important rules in this app so that you can focus on what really matters: the content of your motivation letter.",
    "answer3": "Yes, it's completely free! No hidden fees, no subscriptions. However, you can only use the app 5 times per day.",
    "answer4": "The private data never leaves your browser. This means: We don't store any data you enter into the app. The address data is only stored locally in your browser and is not sent to our servers. This means your data remains secure and private.",
    "answer5": "We currently use Gemini Flash 2.0 as artificial intelligence.",
    "answer6": "You can use the support chat to ask further questions.",
